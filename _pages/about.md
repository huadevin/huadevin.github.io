I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2020 with a degree in Data Science, and now I am working as a Software Developer, Data Systems at YouthTruth Student Survey. I love being a part of a non-profit organization that is focused on creating an environment where students can really thrive in school! This work really encourages and drives me everyday knowing that I can make a difference in these students' lives and potentially change their life trajectory for the better! 

I also have had the privilege of being mentored by many amazing people, whom all have really inspired me to make my life about helping others. I would definitely not be where I am today without all their help and support! Now, outside of work, I get the opportunity to love and mentor back as a Christian mentor for high school students. Check out what weâ€™re up to as we try to raise up the next generation of youth!
